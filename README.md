Tamrielic Names is a [NND](https://github.com/adya/NPCs-Names-Distributor)-based mod that names all previously unnamed (generic) NPCs, such as "Whiterun Guard", "Merchant", "Thief", etc. goes well with mods such as Populated Skyrim that add even more nameless NPCs.

See [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) on Nexus for detailed description.
